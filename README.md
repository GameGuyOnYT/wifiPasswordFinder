## wifiPasswordRememberer

# WARNING : THIS PROJECT ONLY WORKS ON PREVIOUSLY CONNECTED NETWORKS. DO NOT TRY TO USE MALICIOUSLY.
A project I made in an hour. Uses the ___netsh wlan show profile name="" key=clear___ command to get the password of WiFi networks you have connected to before.

## Requirements
- Windows (__Windows 10+ recommended__)
- Python
- __Pyperclip__ library (install from __PyPI__)
- __Tkinter__ library (only for __gui.py__, install from __PyPI__)

## Usage
1. Clone this repository
2. Run __gui.py__. (__terminal.py__ if you want a terminal application.)
